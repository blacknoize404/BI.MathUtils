> MathUtils started as a study project to link university mathematics with programming.

MathUtils is a Java library where algebraic expressions are objects: you build them as evaluable trees, evaluate them lazily and manipulate them symbolically.

Plain Java evaluates math eagerly. You pass values in and get a number out, so the formula itself cannot be inspected or transformed. Keeping the expression as a tree makes that possible, and it is the base for the derivatives, limits and integrals with steps of the symbolic engine.

## Features

### 1. Typed, evaluable expression trees
You build formulas by chaining methods on the `Function` class, so there are no strings to get wrong.
```java
Var x = new Var("x");
Function f = new Function(x).sin().pow(2).mult(3).add(new Cos(x)); // 3·sin²(x) + cos(x)
double y = f.eval(new Evaluation("x", Math.PI)); // → 3·0 + (-1) = -1
```
- **Lazy evaluation with variable substitution:** values are computed on demand from the immutable `Evaluation` record.
- **Structural equality** (`equalsTo`): two trees are equal if they have exactly the same shape and operands, which is stricter than comparing numeric values.
- **N-ary operators:** Structures like `SumOperator` and `MultOperator` accept multiple operands without artificial binary chaining.

### 2. Elementary function catalog
The library includes `Const`, `Var`, `Sin`, `Cos`, `Tan`, `Cot`, `Log`, `LogN`, `Sqrt`, `Cbrt`, `Root`, `Pow`, `Fraction`; each is a `MathElement` and composes with operators.

### 3. 2D/3D vectors with documented mathematical contracts
Generic inheritance `Vector<V extends Vector<V>>` with:
- Addition, subtraction, dot product, cross product, norm, angle, unit vector, orthogonality.
- **Documentation with references to Stewart Calculus 7th ed.** (section and page) on every method.

### 4. Analytic geometry
Modules `Point2D`, `Point3D`, `Line2D`, `Line3D`, `Plane`, `Space`, and `Curve` perform absolute distance, intersection, and spatial projection calculations.

### 5. Combinatorics and statistics
- Combinatorial calculations via `Factorial` and `Combinatory` (binomial and multinomial models).
- Weighted mean with `WeightedMean`.

### 6. Series, sequences, and utilities
Progressions with `Serie` and `Sequence`. Also numerical base conversion utilities and angle management (`Angle` in degrees, radians, and gradians).

## Quick Start

```bash
mvn compile
mvn test
```

## Integration Example

```java
Var x = new Var("x");
Var y = new Var("y");

// Hierarchical tree construction: (x · y + sin(x)) / 2
Function f = new Function(x).mult(y).add(new Sin(x)).div(new Const(2));

// Evaluation with immutable variable passing
double r = f.eval(new Evaluation("x", 1.0), new Evaluation("y", 4.0));
// r ≈ 2.4207
```

- **Algebraic interpreter:** Shunting Yard algorithm to transform direct text expressions into `Function` objects and clean LaTeX export.
- **Advanced linear algebra:** Native support for matrices, SVD decomposition, eigenvalues, and linear system solvers.
- Complex numbers
- ODEs / numerical analysis (root finding, interpolation, adaptive quadrature)
- Advanced probability, optimization, Fourier transforms, special functions, tensor algebra
